- Add in user login, register and authentication for the player to save their progress
- Add in player skills, armour, and weapons
- Add in NPCS for the player to interact with on their journey
- Complete the full storyline for both Nyx & Alara

## Key Learnings 

This project really testing my skills in full stack development as well as my creativity skills. The hardest part of this project was building my database with MySQL and linking all the primary keys and foreign keys with its respective ending links, choice links, and scenario links. Styling my application is always the fun part! I enjoy adding backgronud music to give the game a more immersive feel and I wanted to make it mobile responsive for users to play it on their mobile devices.

## About the developer

Hey there! My name is Chelsea Quindipan and I'm thrilled to present "Mythic Tails: Cursebreaker's Odyssey," a passion project born during my time at the Software Engineering Bootcamp at BrainStation. As a huge fan of video games, I wanted to create something special that brought back the charm of those classic story-driven and choose-your-own-adventure games that enchanted us in the past. As part of my Software Engineering Bootcamp at BrainStation, this project serves as my final Capstone endeavor, combining my technical skills and creativity to bring this fantasy world to life.
